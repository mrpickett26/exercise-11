## F stat 144.5 on 2 and 10983 DF, this larger value indicates greater dispersion of the data from the mean. Both F statistics seem relatively large.

## The associated p value of the F statistic is very small, and F statistic is very large  which means that at least one group that differs from the other and that the between group variance (dependence on Migration status) is greater than the variance within each migration status

##Based on the model output, what would you conclude about how relative beak length is related to these two variables?

m_two_way <- summary(lm(resid_BL_mass2 ~ d$Primary.Lifestyle + d$Migration))

## None of the values indicate significance, leading me to conclude that beak length is not related to the outcomes of all the variables .

  xlab = "Tropic Level",
  trace.factor =  d$Primary.Lifestyle,
  trace.label = "Primary Lifestyle",
  # make sure we use {base} version
  fun = mean,
  response = d$Migration,
  ylab = "Mean Migration"
)

#Based on the model output, what would you now conclude about how relative beak length is related to these two variables?
## I could not plot lifestyle vs tropic level... they are both categorical so I am not sure if that would make sense. Type of plot that displays the fitted values of a response variable on the y-axis and the values of the first factor on the x-axis. Meanwhile, the lines in the plot represent the values of the second factor of interest. If the two lines on the interaction plot are parallel then there is no interaction effect. However, if the lines intersect then there is likely an interaction effect. In this case there is an interaction of migrations insessorial and terrestials of herbivores and omnivores.
